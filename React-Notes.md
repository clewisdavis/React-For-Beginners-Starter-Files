# Notes from WesBos, React for Beginners

## Intro and Set up

- Fork the starter files, from the [React For Beginners Starter Files](https://github.com/wesbos/React-For-Beginners-Starter-Files) repo

## Thinking and Understanding React Components

- Everything in React is a component
- Re-usable peice of your website, similar to <h1> etc.
- Allow you to build your own tags.
- And attach data and functionality

## Creating our first Component

## Writing HTML with JSX

- Mix of HTML and JS
- JSX is not required to write a React app. But preferred
- But really hard to write
- Things to look out for.
- Can't just use `class`, when you want to add a class you have to write `className`
- If returning multiple lines, automatic semi-colon insertion can break the JS
- Easy solution is to just add `()` after your return. `return()`
- Remember, return is not a function, it's a keyword
- Cannot return siblings elements.
- From a render method, you can only return sibling elements.
- Solution, you can wrap in a `<React.Fragment>` tag and return as many as like.
- Previously what you did, was render a dummy `<div>` but messes up your DOM with a bunch of empty `<div>`
- Or, you can just import `Fragment` and wrap your elements in `<Fragment>`
- Commenting is different, `{}`, curly brackets means you are in JS land. So a comment looks like `{ /* comment */ }`
- And don't put a comment directly after return. Will break. If you want a comment then put it inside your element.

```CODE
render() {
    return (
        <form className="store-selector">
          { /* comment */ }
          <h2>Please enter store</h2>
        </form>
    )
}
```
